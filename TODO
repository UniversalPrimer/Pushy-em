Test results
--------------------
 
  Firefox 3.0 and 3.6:
    Working 100% with xhr_streaming transport

  IE 6, 7 and 8:
    Working 100% with html_file transport

  Chrome 4.0:
    Mostly working.
    Weirdness on auto-reconnect:
      It keeps trying to reconnect for some reason.
      When I finally let it connect, it had three connections going!

  Chrome 5.0:
    Untested

  Safari 3.0:
    Untested

  Opera 9 to 10.10:
    100% working except onunload is only triggered on navigate away
    this is because of limitations in Opera

  Opera >10.10 to 10.60
    Not working with sse due to weird bug, but falls back to long polling and works fine.
    
  Opera 10.7 (still in beta)
    Working with sse_new transport.


--------------------
TODO and bugs
--------------------

Add support for sending messages from JS client. 
  Use Ajax.Request (even longpoll uses that)

Add support for APE-style *.pushy.uprimer.org and make sure all transports work. We'll have to set document.domain. See notes in html_file.js for more info.

Test that channel names can be anything

Better error handling!
  Right now errors are caught, but nothing is done except to display an error message. The only error conditions that are handled are disconnects with auto-reconnect and max tries before it gives up.

Port the simple join/leave channel, send/receive message JS code from APE to Pushy.

Update Emcee to work with this new library

Protect from duplicate events:
  Opera bug in at least 9.52 sends all events again after a while if the server shuts down. This could be as simple as having the event sequence counter.
  -- Hmm I'm pretty sure I already did this, but I'm going to go check in the code to make 100% sure (Juul)

implement WebSockets transport

Bug:
  ping based disconnect detection (such as in sse) waits _a lot_ longer than non ping based detection (such as in xhr_streaming). this should be fixed.
